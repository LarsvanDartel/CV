    As a double bachelor student in Computer Science \& Engineering and Applied Mathematics I have developed skills in advanced programming and logical thinking. I enjoy putting these skills to use in creating innovative technologies, with a particular interest in the fields of computer networks, embedded systems and robotics. Working as Chief Electronics \& Software in student team TU/ecomotive has allowed me to develop my skills in a practical setting, as well as my communication and organisation skills.
